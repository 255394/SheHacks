##Idea

This is a project on arduino with ultrasonic sensors, it sends out a sound singal at a specific frequency and receive an echo corresponding to that sound signal. 

By this we can calculate the distance between our device and the object facing it. By this we are aiming to help blind people and making their life more easier.

We will attach this device in a belt , which is to be weared by blind people. Whenever an object will come infront of them, a buzzer will weep.

Sound of weeping varies at different frequencies according to the distance.
In this project we are using an arduino ,ultrasonic sensor , buzzer.

It proves to be very useful for them ,it protects them from any sudden accident and make them self dependent.
Till now we have calculated the distance between the person and the object.
